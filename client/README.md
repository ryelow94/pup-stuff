# Submission Detials

Please read the following details before you click 'Mark as Done' to your submission 
1. Make sure that all your code is merged to the Main branch
2. Include all files necessary to run your app, NOT just the source code, except for the **node_modules** folder
3. Here is an example of how we will test your code 

# Important 
In order to search by tag, the complete tagname must be typed. If i were to spend more time on this, I would try to solve that issue. Furthermore, I'd like to figure out a way to remove individual tags from individual students, not just every tag. Lastly, I'd like to add some cleaner looking styling to the buttons.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git
npm install # or yarn install
npm start  
```

Your app should be running on `http://localhost:3000` or whichever PORT number you specify.

If your app had a different instructions to start, then you must edit this README.md file and list out the instructions to successfully run your code.
